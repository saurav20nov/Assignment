    "The bias-variance tradeoff is a key concept in machine learning that describes the balance between two types of errors in a predictive model: bias and variance. Bias refers to the error that occurs when a model makes overly simplistic assumptions about the underlying relationships in the data, leading to systematic underfitting. Variance, on the other hand, refers to the error that occurs when a model is overly sensitive to small fluctuations in the training data and as a result, overfits to the training data.\n",

High variance and low bias models, on the other hand, often overfit the training data, meaning they have high predictive power on the training data but do not generalize well to new data. Therefore, the goal in machine learning is to find the optimal balance between bias and variance that minimizes the overall error of the model on both the training and test data.\n",

    "Train and Test Accuracy: Comparing the accuracy of the model on the training set and test set can help detect overfitting and underfitting. If the training accuracy is much higher than the test accuracy, it's a sign of overfitting. Conversely, if both accuracies are low, it indicates underfitting.\n",

It involves splitting the data into k-folds and training the model on k-1 folds while evaluating it on the remaining fold. If the model performs well on all folds, it suggests that the model is not overfitting. Conversely, if the model performs well on the training folds but poorly on the validation folds, it indicates overfitting.\n",
