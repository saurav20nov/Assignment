    "Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF) are two important concepts in probability theory and statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Probability Mass Function (PMF) is a function that gives the probability of discrete outcomes of a discrete random variable. In other words, it gives the probability that a random variable takes on a particular value. The PMF is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X = x) = probability that the random variable X takes on the value x.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, X is the random variable and x is a possible value that X can take. The PMF has some properties, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "The values of the PMF are between 0 and 1.\n",
    "The sum of the PMF over all possible values of X is equal to 1.\n",
    "For example, consider a random variable X that represents the outcome of rolling a fair six-sided die. The PMF of X is:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X = 1) = 1/6\n",
    "P(X = 2) = 1/6\n",
    "P(X = 3) = 1/6\n",
    "P(X = 4) = 1/6\n",
    "P(X = 5) = 1/6\n",
    "P(X = 6) = 1/6\n",
    "\n",
    "The PMF of X gives the probability that the die roll will result in each possible outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a Probability Density Function (PDF) is a function that describes the probability distribution of a continuous random variable. In contrast to the PMF, the PDF cannot give the probability of a specific value of the continuous random variable. Instead, it gives the probability of the random variable being in a particular interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PDF is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "f(x) = probability density function of the random variable X at the point x.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, X is the continuous random variable and x is a point on the real line. The PDF has some properties, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "The values of the PDF are non-negative.\n",
    "The integral of the PDF over the entire real line is equal to 1.\n",
    "For example, consider a continuous random variable X that represents the height of people in a population. The PDF of X might be a bell-shaped curve known as the normal distribution. The PDF of X gives the probability that a person's height falls within a particular range of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the PMF is used for discrete random variables, while the PDF is used for continuous random variables. The PMF gives the probability of specific values, while the PDF gives the probability of intervals of values."
