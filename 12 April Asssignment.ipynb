    "Q1. How does bagging reduce overfitting in decision trees?\n",
    "Ans 1. Bagging reduces overfitting in decision trees by training multiple trees on different subsets of the training data. Since each tree is trained on a random subset, they are likely to capture different aspects of the data, reducing the chance of overfitting present in any single tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using different types of base learners in bagging?\n",
    "Ans 2. The advantages of using different types of base learners in bagging include increased diversity in the ensemble, which can lead to better overall performance. However, the disadvantage is that it may increase computational complexity and require tuning to ensure compatibility among the base learners.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. How does the choice of base learner affect the bias-variance tradeoff in bagging?\n",
    "Ans 3. The choice of base learner affects the bias-variance tradeoff in bagging by influencing the bias and variance of the ensemble. Complex base learners tend to have low bias but high variance, while simpler base learners have higher bias but lower variance. Bagging reduces variance by averaging or voting over multiple base learners, leading to a reduction in overall variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Can bagging be used for both classification and regression tasks? How does it differ in each case?\n",
    "Ans 4. Yes, bagging can be used for both classification and regression tasks. In classification, bagging typically involves training multiple classifiers (e.g., decision trees) on different subsets of the training data and combining their predictions through voting. In regression, bagging similarly involves training multiple regression models on different subsets of the data and averaging their predictions. The difference lies in how the predictions are combined, but the underlying principle of aggregating multiple models remains the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. What is the role of ensemble size in bagging? How many models should be included in the ensemble?\n",
    "Ans 5. The ensemble size in bagging refers to the number of base learners included in the ensemble. A larger ensemble size generally leads to better performance up to a certain point, after which the performance may plateau or even decrease due to diminishing returns or increased computational cost. The optimal ensemble size depends on factors such as the complexity of the problem, the diversity of the base learners, and computational resources available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Can you provide an example of a real-world application of bagging in machine learning?\n",
    "Ans 6. One real-world application of bagging in machine learning is in financial forecasting. For instance, in stock market prediction, bagging can be used to combine the predictions of multiple models trained on historical financial data to forecast stock prices or market trends. By leveraging the diversity of different models, bagging can improve the accuracy and reliability of predictions, which is crucial for making informed investment decisions."
