    "In Python, you can access a file by using the open() method. However, using the open() method directly requires you to use the close() method to close the file explicitly. Instead, you can create a context using the with Open statement in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike open() where you have to close the file with the close() method, the with statement closes the file for you without you telling it to.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because the with statement calls 2 built-in methods behind the scene – __enter()__ and __exit()__.\n",
    "\n",
    "The __exit()__ method closes the file when the operation you specify is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "With statement closes the file for us and we get to write less code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The with statement provides a way for ensuring that a clean-up is always used by closing the file always.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the “With” statement, you get better syntax and exception handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearing resources on your system is extremely important and it helps in doing that.\n"
