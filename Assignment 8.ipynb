    "High-Level Design (HLD) for Predicting Flight Price with Random Forest:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "The project aims to develop a flight price prediction system using the Random Forest algorithm. The system will analyze historical flight data and various features to estimate the price of future flights accurately. The HLD provides an overview of the system architecture and its major components.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "The flight price prediction system consists of the following major components:\n",
    "   a. Data Ingestion: This component is responsible for collecting and processing flight data from various sources, such as airline databases, APIs, and historical flight datasets.\n",
    "   b. Feature Engineering: This component performs data preprocessing and feature extraction techniques to transform raw flight data into meaningful input features for the Random Forest model.\n",
    "   c. Model Training: In this component, the Random Forest algorithm is applied to the preprocessed flight data to build a predictive model. The model is trained using historical flight prices and their corresponding features.\n",
    "   d. Model Evaluation: This component assesses the performance of the trained model using suitable evaluation metrics, such as mean absolute error (MAE) or root mean square error (RMSE).\n",
    "   e. Model Deployment: The final component involves deploying the trained model in a production environment, allowing users to input flight information and receive predicted flight prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. System Architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The flight price prediction system follows a client-server architecture, where the server hosts the model and handles user requests. The high-level architecture includes the following components:\n",
    "   a. User Interface: This component provides a user-friendly interface for users to input flight details, such as origin, destination, date, and other relevant parameters.\n",
    "   b. Application Server: The application server receives user requests, validates the inputs, and communicates with the model server to obtain flight price predictions.\n",
    "   c. Model Server: The model server hosts the trained Random Forest model and provides the prediction functionality. It receives feature inputs from the application server, applies the model, and returns the predicted flight price.\n",
    "   d. Database: The system may utilize a database to store and retrieve historical flight data, including flight prices, dates, origins, destinations, and other relevant features.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Ingestion:\n",
    "   a. Identify relevant data sources, such as airline databases and APIs, and determine the data retrieval mechanism.\n",
    "   b. Design a data ingestion pipeline that collects flight data in real-time or scheduled intervals.\n",
    "   c. Preprocess the raw flight data, perform data cleansing, handle missing values, and transform the data into a suitable format for feature engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Feature Engineering:\n",
    "   a. Select relevant features for flight price prediction, such as departure and arrival times, airline, route, and historical pricing trends.\n",
    "   b. Apply feature engineering techniques, including one-hot encoding, feature scaling, and dimensionality reduction, to prepare the data for model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Model Training:\n",
    "   a. Split the preprocessed data into training and testing datasets using appropriate strategies like time-based or random sampling.\n",
    "   b. Implement the Random Forest algorithm and train the model using the training dataset.\n",
    "   c. Optimize the model parameters, such as the number of trees, maximum depth, and minimum sample split, using techniques like grid search or random search.\n",
    "   d. Evaluate the trained model's performance using evaluation metrics such as MAE, RMSE, or R-squared on the testing dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Model Deployment:\n",
    "   a. Develop a RESTful API or web service to expose the flight price prediction functionality. \n",
    "   b. Create an application server that handles user requests, validates inputs, and interacts with the model server.\n",
    "   c. Set up a model server to host the trained Random Forest model, enabling the application server to request predictions.\n",
    "   d. Implement a database to store historical flight data for training and retrieve relevant information for feature               engineering and prediction.\n",

    "5. User Interface:\n",
    "   a. Design a user-friendly interface where users can input flight details, such as origin, destination, date, and other           parameters.\n",
    "   b. Validate user inputs to ensure they meet the required format and range constraints.\n",
    "   c. Connect the user interface with the application server to send user inputs and receive flight price predictions.\n",
