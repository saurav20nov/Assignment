    "Estimation statistics is a branch of statistics that deals with estimating the value of a population parameter based on a sample statistic. In other words, estimation statistics is used to make inferences about the population based on information obtained from a sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of estimation: point estimation and interval estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Point estimation involves using a single value to estimate the population parameter. For example, if we want to estimate the mean height of all people in a particular country, we could take a sample of people and calculate the mean height of that sample. This calculated mean height is then used as a point estimate for the mean height of the entire population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interval estimation, on the other hand, involves estimating the population parameter by specifying a range of values that we are reasonably sure the true population parameter lies within. This range is called a confidence interval. For example, we might calculate a 95% confidence interval for the mean height of people in a particular country based on a sample, which would mean that we are 95% confident that the true mean height of the population falls within that range of values.\n",

    "Hypothesis testing is used in various fields such as science, business, and social sciences to test the validity of claims or theories. It is typically used to make decisions based on data, such as accepting or rejecting a null hypothesis, which is a statement that there is no significant difference between the observed data and the expected or assumed data. The alternative hypothesis is the opposite of the null hypothesis and represents the research question or theory being tested.\n",
