The goal is to train a model to predict the output for new input data. For example, if we have a dataset of images of fruits labeled as apples, oranges, and bananas, we can train a model to predict the type of fruit for new images based on the input features such as color, texture, and shape. The key characteristic of supervised learning is that the model is trained on a labeled dataset.\n",

The goal is to find patterns and structure in the data. For example, we can use unsupervised learning to cluster similar images of fruits together, without knowing which fruits they represent. The key characteristic of unsupervised learning is that the model is trained on an unlabeled dataset.\n",

    "Semi-supervised Learning: In semi-supervised learning, the data is partially labeled, meaning that only some of the input data is accompanied by the corresponding output data. The goal is to use the labeled data to guide the learning of the model and improve its performance on the unlabeled data. For example, we can use semi-supervised learning to train a model to recognize different types of fruits, using a small labeled dataset and a larger unlabeled dataset of fruit images. The key characteristic of semi-supervised learning is that the model is trained on both labeled and unlabeled data.\n",
